Description:

It is a MERN stack development.

Backend (Express.js)
Express & Middleware: I use Express with CORS and JSON parsing for handling requests.
Database: MongoDB with Mongoose for managing feedback data via a schema.
Routes: Feedback submissions are routed through a dedicated endpoint (/feedback), where user data is received and saved to the database.
Error Handling: Errors are caught and logged, with appropriate responses sent back to the client.

Frontend (React)
React Router: I utilize React Router to manage navigation between different pages (home and feedback).
State Management: useState is employed to handle user input for feedback forms.
Form Submission: The form submits feedback via a POST request to the backend.

Toastify:
react-toastify is used for displaying notifications. In your GiveFeedback component, it shows a success message upon a successful form submission, enhancing user experience by providing immediate feedback.
